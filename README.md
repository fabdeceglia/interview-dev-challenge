# DevChallenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.4.

DEV test for an interview.
The request was to create a form with 3 steps.
Each step with its own validation. The next step is available only if the previous is valid.
The validation is asynchronous.

In the desktop view, the form is vertical.
In the mobile view, each step is a page of carousel/slider.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
